# PHP Sandbox Playground

This project is an outcome of my love towards two things:

1. [Tehplayground](https://www.tehplayground.com/)
2. [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/)

Since the introduction of [Cloudflare Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/), I was searching for a valid usecase. And as they mentioned about **Sandboxed environment**, immediate thing which striked my mind was Tehplayground. I love that tool and it is a crucial part of my workflow whenever I code in PHP.
